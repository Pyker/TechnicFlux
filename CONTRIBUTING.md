# Contribution Guidelines
Contributions are what make the open source community such an amazing place to be, learn, inspire, and create. Any
contributions you make are **greatly appreciated**. Our goal as a project is to be open to feedback and contributions,
fostering an active community in which you can truly be involved in improving TechnicFlux and keeping it bug-free.
* If you have suggestions for adding or removing features, feel free to [open an issue](https://github.com/Zandercraft/TechnicFlux/issues/new)
  to discuss it, or directly [create a pull request](#creating-a-pull-request).
* Please make sure you check your spelling and grammar.
* Make sure your changes comply with StandardJS code style by running `standard --fix` and fixing any issues.
* Ensure that you update the README.md to match any changes your PR includes.
* Ensure that you update the latest Unreleased entry in [CHANGELOG.md](./CHANGELOG.md) with your changes.
* Create individual PRs for each suggestion, bug-fix, or enhancement.
    * Use new branches on your fork to separate different changes _(see [Creating A Pull Request](#creating-a-pull-request))_.
